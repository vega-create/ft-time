The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses timed intervals to break work into focused sessions.

## How It Works

Set a timer for 25 minutes and work on a single task with full focus. When the timer rings, take a 5-minute break. After four sessions, take a longer break of 15-30 minutes. Each 25-minute session is called a pomodoro.

## Why It Works

The technique combats two common productivity killers: perfectionism and procrastination. The fixed time constraint reduces the anxiety of starting. Knowing a break is coming makes it easier to maintain focus.

## Tips for Success

During a pomodoro, ignore all interruptions. If something comes up, write it down and return to it later. Track how many pomodoros each task takes to improve future estimates. Adjust the intervals to fit your work style.

## Common Variations

Some people prefer 50-minute work sessions with 10-minute breaks. Others use 15-minute pomodoros for administrative tasks. Experiment with different intervals to find what works best for you.

## Getting Started
