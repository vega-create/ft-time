Scheduling meetings across time zones is one of the biggest challenges of remote work. With team members spread globally, finding a time that works for everyone requires strategy.

## The Golden Hours

For most timezone combinations, there are a few hours of overlap during normal working hours. For US East Coast and Europe, the window is typically 9 AM-12 PM EST (2 PM-5 PM CET). For US and Asia, early morning US or late evening Asia may be the only options.

## Rotating Meeting Times

If no single time works well for everyone, rotate meeting times so the inconvenience is shared equally. This is fairer than always making one timezone accommodate the others.

## Async-First Approach

Not every meeting needs to be synchronous. Use recorded video updates, shared documents, and threaded discussions to reduce the number of live meetings required.

## Tools and Strategies

Use our Meeting Planner to visualize working hours across zones. Color-coded grids show work hours, off hours, and sleep times at a glance. Our World Clock helps you quickly check what time it is for your colleagues.

## Cultural Considerations

Some cultures start work earlier or later. Lunch times vary by country. Be aware of local holidays and non-working days. When in doubt, ask your team members about their preferred meeting windows.
